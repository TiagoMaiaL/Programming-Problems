# Number Appears Once

You're given an array of integers.  Each integer in the array appears exactly TWICE except one which appears only once.  Write a function `findSingleInteger` that returns the integer which appears only once.

For example, if the input array is `[10,20,30,40,50,10,20,40,50]` then `30` is the integer which appears only once.

As always, get a version that works regardless of performance and then optimize.

- Can you do this in `O(n)` time?
- Can you do this in `O(1)` space?
- If the array were sorted, could you do it in `O(log n)` time?
